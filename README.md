Kitchen Safety Monitoring Using Gas and Smoke Detecting Alarm system <br />
By employing a gas sensor and flame sensor in Proteus, a system was implemented to detect the presence of gas and smoke to ensure a safe kitchen environment. LabVIEW was then used to integrate the results and display them in a tabular format.If there is smoke or gas, the system will buzzer as an alarm. Otherwise, it is ensured that there are no fires or gas leaks and that the kitchen environment is secure.
